# Websockets from Scratch with Python & JavaScript

Learn how to use websockets from scratch by creating a micro version of Jupyter. We'll be using both Python and JavaScript to make this happen.


##### Watch the tutoiral series [here](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/projects/websockets-scratch-python-javascript)


In this one, we'll be creating a _micro_ version of Jupyter. That means we'll be using Websockets to call and run Python scripts from the browser using Javascript.

The goal is to introduce you to the concept of websockets while providing you with a deeper look into the amazing tool that is Jupyter.
